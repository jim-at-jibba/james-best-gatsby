## Pentesterlabs

Currently working through the Unix badge. Today I completed:

- Unix - Lab #15: crack password with john, password in copy of shadow file
  - Copy the **whole** line (inclduing the username) from the shadow file. To start with I only copied the
    part I thought was the hash and I could not get it to work.
- Unix - Lab #16: crack password with john, password in copy of shadow file, this time the hash
  was MD5
